* Add todo list sharing and friend/social feature (5)
* Add screenshots to readme.md (1)
* Add project to portfolio (1)
* Fix logic in that one file - like all warnings about using elixir wrong (there are plenty to choose from) (1)
* Vix redirects after login, todo add, etc. (1)
* Clean up this todo list (a lot)
* Figure out page-specific javascript loading in a robust way (docs / this guide: http://ethanfrei.com/posts/multiple_javascripts_in_phoenix.html)

## Add JSON routes for the DB
* WIP!

## Add many-to-many table for user relationships
* Sounds hard! Maybe do something different? 
* Instead of many to many, look into this kind of relation table: http://www.codedodle.com/2014/12/social-network-friends-database.html
* Also think: do we really need many-to-many, or are we hard coding a single pairing?

# User picture upload
* Image data into a table, sounds exciting!
